  "description": "This is a basic web server using Node.js and Express. The web server listens on port 3000 and has a path to add a product to inventory. The inventory is stored in an array in the 'Inventory' class. The code also includes a function to check if the inventory is empty or not. In addition to that you can list and search the products."
